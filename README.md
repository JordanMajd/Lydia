## About

Lydia is a thoughtfully created, RESTfully controlled quadruped robot. She's fun to play with and easy to build.

Lydia is made to be simple. She's 100% 3D printable and is powered by an ESP8266 so any device with WiFi can be used as a controller.

If you like or are using this project, please give it a :star: for motivation :)

## Project Setup

Instructions how to flash and program ESP8266 can be found [here](/arduino/README.md). More instructions will be released with time, including how to print everything and what parts to order.


## Project Roadmap

- Write webserver API.
- Write client to contact with API.
- Write servo control.
- Write printing instructions.
- Write parts list.
